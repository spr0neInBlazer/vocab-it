Done:
- improve light/dark mode styling
- add Arial Rounded font
- input validations
- exit edit mode on Esc press
- responsiveness:
  + scroll on mobile screen (try dvh)
  + home down button doesn't show
  ? light theme doesn't work correctly (only in Opera)
  + make fonts bigger
  + navbar "Account" link works only on the text and not on the field 
- error page
- alerts/notifications

- fix editVocabTitlebug;
- sound effects

---------------------
- optimization
- refactor the code (DRY & move code to components)
- remove unused code (UI)
- add default vocab with words for demonstration 

Features (needs back-end):
- regulate lessons frequency
- achievements
- graph stats
Other possible features:
- make bg word cloud move with the mouse (3d effect)
- allow adding multiple translations
- allow uploading words as a file (e.g CSV)

Account page:
- Name (edit name)
- (?) User achievements
- Vocabularies (create vocab button):
  - No vocabularies yet
  - list of vocabularies:
    - start a lesson, edit button, delete button
- Lessons:
  - Current Schedule:
    - (select option):
      - every day, every 2 days, every 3 days, once a week
    - words per lesson
- User stats

Vocabulary:
- edit button/ delete button
- stats (words in total)
- list of words:
  - word:
    - edit button, delete button
- (?) assess word's learning progress (red - bad, orange - average, green - good, gray - learnt)

Ideas for test cases:
Vocabs navbar:
- when no vocabs exist yet
- invalid title / valid title 
Vocab:
- too long title
- when going to other pages with edit mode on, cancel edit mode on page load
Profile page:
- forbid editing more than one field at once
